# lib/cmd_utils.sh â€” lightweight command helpers
#
# These helpers are intentionally dependency-free so that other libraries can
# source them without bringing in heavier logging layers.  Each function is
# exported so that scripts executed via `bash -c` can re-use them.

# Return 0 when the provided command exists in PATH.

# Execute the given command via sudo only when not already running as root.
# Tests can force the non-root branch by exporting SC_CMD_UTILS_EUID_OVERRIDE.
